# BulkRNAseq
These files are notes related to my work at Yale University, in the Brennand Lab, using bulk RNA sequencing to evaluated a myriad of psychiatric conditions, drug effects, and cellular processes.
Included are files used for gaining familiarity and training other users to use High Performance Clusters (HPCs) provided by the Yale Center for Research Computing (YCRC). This includes files last updated in February, 2024. 

These projects do not use data that is required to be HIPPA compliant and therefore will use the McCleary cluster. More info here: https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/mccleary/.
